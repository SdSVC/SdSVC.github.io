The anbik is also called the raʾs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

For later chemists it denotes various parts of crude distillation devices.\n\n\n\nAlembic drawings appear in works of Cleopatra the Alchemist, Synesius, and Zosimos of Panopolis. There were alembics with two (dibikos) and three (tribikos) receivers.[4] According to Zosimos of Panopolis, the alembic was invented by Mary the Jewess.[5]\n\nThe anbik is described by Ibn al-Awwam in his Kitab al-Filaha (Book of Agriculture), where he explains how rose-water is distilled. Amongst others, it is mentioned in the Mafatih al-Ulum (Key of Sciences) of Khwarizmi and the Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets) of Al-Razi. Some illustrations occur in the Latin translations of works which are attributed to Geber.[2]\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

    "content": "Welcome to SdSV Challenge 2020!\n\nThe main goal of the SdSV Challenge 2020 is to evaluate new technologies for text-dependent (TD) and text-independent (TI) speaker verification (SV) in short duration scenario.\n\nThe challenge evaluates SdSV with varying degree of phonetic overlap between the enrollment and test utterances. It is the first challenge with a broad focus on systematic benchmark and analysis on varying degree of phonetic variability on short-duration speaker recognition.\n\nThe evaluation dataset used for the challenge is drawn from the recently released multi-purpose DeepMine dataset[1]. The dataset has three parts and among them Part 1 is used for TD-SV while Part 3 is for TI-SV.\n\n[1] H. Zeinali, L. Burget, J.

ASRU 2019 The 2019 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop, 2019 (2019).\n\nThe full challenge evaluation plane version 1.0 can be found in this link.

When creating an account, please select a team name that can be the name of your organization or any anonymous identity if you want to participate blindly.\n\nAs explained in the challenge description, there are two separate tasks in the challenge. So, there is a separate competition webpage for each task. Participants can register in just one competition or both. If you are going to participate in both tasks, we kindly ask you to use the same user account (team name) to participate in both tasks. The competition pages at CodaLab are:\n\n\n  Task 1, Text-Dependent Speaker Verification\n  Task 2, Text-Independent Speaker Verification\n\n\nBecause the evaluation dataset is a subset of the DeepMine dataset, in addition to creating the CodaLab account, teams need to fill and sign the dataset’s License Agreement. After signing the agreement, the scanned version of the signed agreement should send back to the challenge organizations by the challenge email: sdsvc2020[at]gmail.com. We will contact you when receiving the agreement. The dataset download links will send to the team’s corresponding user.\n\n",
