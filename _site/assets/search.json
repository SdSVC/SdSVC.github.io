The anbik is also called the raʾs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver. A modern descendant of the alembic is the pot still, used to produce distilled beverages.\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

For later chemists it denotes various parts of crude distillation devices.\n\n\n\nAlembic drawings appear in works of Cleopatra the Alchemist, Synesius, and Zosimos of Panopolis. There were alembics with two (dibikos) and three (tribikos) receivers.[4] According to Zosimos of Panopolis, the alembic was invented by Mary the Jewess.[5]\n\nThe anbik is described by Ibn al-Awwam in his Kitab al-Filaha (Book of Agriculture), where he explains how rose-water is distilled. Amongst others, it is mentioned in the Mafatih al-Ulum (Key of Sciences) of Khwarizmi and the Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets) of Al-Razi. Some illustrations occur in the Latin translations of works which are attributed to Geber.[2]\n\nOriginally from Alembic - Wikipedia\n",

        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

    "content": "Welcome to SdSV Challenge 2021!\n\nFollowing the success of the SdSV Challenge 2020, the SdSV Challenge 2021 focuses on systematic benchmark and analysis on varying degrees of phonetic variability on short-duration speaker recognition.\n\nChallenge Tasks\n\nThe SdSV Challenge 2021 consists of two tasks:\n\n\n  Task 1 is defined as speaker verification in a text-dependent mode where the lexical content (in both English and Persian) of the test utterances is also taken into consideration.\n  Task 2 is defined as speaker verification in a text-independent mode with same- and cross-language trials.\n\n\nChallenge Dataset\n\nThe evaluation dataset of the challenge is drawn from the recently released multi-purpose DeepMine dataset[1]. The dataset has three parts and among them, Part 1 is used for TD-SV while Part 3 is for TI-SV.\n\n[1] H. Zeinali, L. Burget, J. Cernocky, A multi-purpose and large scale speech corpus in Persian and English for speaker and speech recognition:  the DeepMine database, in:  Proc. ASRU 2019 The 2019 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop, 2019 (2019).\n\nChallenge x-vector Baseline\n\nThe Kaldi baseline recipe for both tasks can be found in this link. For running the baseline you should first download both VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2 datasets. Then after downloading the challenge data, by putting the baseline code in the Kaldi egs directory you can run this code.\n\nChallenge Evaluation Plane\n\nThe full challenge evaluation plane version 1.0 can be found in this link. If you have any more questions regarding the challenge you can contact organizers via sdsv.challenge[at]gmail.com.\n\nObjective\n\nThe main purpose of this challenge is to encourage participants on building single but competitive systems, to perform analysis as well as to explore new ideas, such as multi-task learning, unsupervised/self-supervised learning, single-shot learning, disentangled representation learning, and so on, for short-duration speaker verification. The participating teams will get access to a train set and the test set drawn from the DeepMine corpus which is the largest public corpus designed for short-duration speaker verification with voice recordings of 1800 speakers. The challenge leaderboard is hosted at CodaLab.\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\n \n    \n    Jan 10, 2021\n    \n    \n    Release of evaluation plan\n    \n \n \n    \n    Jan 15, 2021\n    \n    \n    Evaluation platform open\n    \n \n \n    \n    Jan 15, 2021\n    \n    \n    Release of train, development and evaluation sets\n    \n \n \n    \n    Mar 20, 2021 \n    \n    \n    Challenge deadline\n    \n \n \n    \n    Mar 29, 2021 \n    \n    \n    Interspeech submission deadline\n    \n \n \n    \n    Aug 20 - Sep 03, 2021\n    \n    \n    SdSV Challenge 2021 special session at Interspeech\n    \n \n  &nbsp; \n\n\n\nSponsors\n\n\n \n    \n\tSharif DeepMine Ltd. \n    \n    \n\t\n    \n \n\n\n",

    "content": "Challenge Registration\n\nThe challenge leaderboards are hosted at CodaLab. Each team needs at least one CodaLab account to be able to submit the results.\n\nParticipation in this challenge is open to all who are interested. There is no cost to participate except writing a system description with at least two pages that should be submitted on time. We highly recommend participants to submit full system description papers to the challenge’s special session at Interspeech 2021 that will be an analysis session.\n\nWe kindly ask participants to use their organization name as the team name. We cannot accept requests from individual researchers due to the terms and conditions of the challenge dataset (DeepMine dataset). Also, each organization is allowed to participate in the challenge using only one account. To control this, you should first create an account in the Codalab platform and ask for registration in this competition from the Participate tab. After that, by sending an email to challenge email (sdsv.challenge[at]gmail.com), your registration will be approved.\n\nThere are two separate tasks in the challenge. So, there is a separate competition webpage for each task. Participants can register in just one competition or both. If you are going to participate in both tasks, we kindly ask you to use the same user account (team name) to participate in both tasks. The competition pages at CodaLab are:\n\n\n  Task 1, Text-Dependent Speaker Verification\n  Task 2, Text-Independent Speaker Verification\n\n\nBecause the evaluation dataset is a subset of the DeepMine dataset, in addition to creating the CodaLab account, teams need to fill and sign the dataset’s License Agreement if did not do it for SdSV Challenge 2020. After signing the agreement, the scanned version of the signed agreement should send back to the challenge organizations by the challenge email: sdsv.challenge[at]gmail.com. We will contact you when receiving the agreement. The dataset download links will send to the team’s corresponding user.\n\n",
