## Welcome to SdSV Challenge 2020! 

The main goal of the SdSV Challenge 2020 is to evaluate new technologies for text-dependent (TD) and text-independent (TI) speaker verification (SV) in short duration scenario.

The challenge evaluates SdSV with varying degree of phonetic overlap between the enrollment and test utterances. It is the first challenge with a broad focus on systematic benchmark and analysis on varying degree of phonetic variability on short-duration speaker recognition.

The evaluation dataset used for the challenge is drawn from the recently released multi-purpose DeepMine dataset[1]. The dataset has three parts and among them Part 1 is used for TD-SV while Part 3 is for TI-SV.
