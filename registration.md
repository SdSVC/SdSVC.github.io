### Challenge Registration
---
The challenge leaderboards are hosted at [CodaLab](https://codalab.org/). Each team needs at least one CodaLab account to be able to submit the results.

Participation in this challenge is open to all who are interested. There is no cost to participate except writing a system description with at least two pages that should be submitted on time. We highly recommend participants to submit full system description papers to the challenge's special session at Interspeech 2021 that will be an analysis session.

We kindly ask participants to use their organization name as the team name. We cannot accept requests from individual researchers due to the terms and conditions of the challenge dataset (DeepMine dataset). Also, each organization is allowed to participate in the challenge using only one account. To control this, you should first create an account in the Codalab platform and ask for registration in this competition from the Participate tab. After that, by sending an email to challenge email (sdsv.challenge[at]gmail.com), your registration will be approved.

There are two separate tasks in the challenge. So, there is a separate competition webpage for each task. Participants can register in just one competition or both. If you are going to participate in both tasks, we kindly ask you to use the same user account (team name) to participate in both tasks. The competition pages at CodaLab are:

- [Task 1, Text-Dependent Speaker Verification](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/28190)
- [Task 2, Text-Independent Speaker Verification](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/28269)

Because the evaluation dataset is a subset of the [DeepMine dataset](http://data.deepmine.ir/en/), in addition to creating the CodaLab account, teams need to fill and sign the dataset's [License Agreement](/assets/SdSV_Challenge_License_Agreement.pdf) if did not do it for SdSV Challenge 2020. After signing the agreement, the scanned version of the signed agreement should send back to the challenge organizations by the challenge email: [sdsv.challenge\[at\]gmail.com](mailto:sdsv.challenge\[at\]gmail.com). We will contact you when receiving the agreement. The dataset download links will send to the team's corresponding user.
