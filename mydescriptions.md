### System Descriptions
---
For the challenge, we had 67 registered teams which some of them failed to prepare any valid system for the challenge. Also, some of the teams only participated in the challenge and did not provide any system descriptions which was not in-line with the challenge rules. 

In the following, you can find all submitted descriptions. Providing the description in a blind format was decided by teams, so some of the following descriptions do not have any author and affiliation information. The descriptions are ordered based on the anonymous team-ids.
